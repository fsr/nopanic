	In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
	And the earth was without form, and void;
	 and it was a static void, and it was private.
	And God said: \enquote{It is not good that the void should be private;
	 I will make it protected,
	 so it can be enjoyed by everyone, and no harm shall befall it.}

	[...]

	And God said: \enquote{Let the earth sprout a great many paradigms and programming patterns,
	 and binary trees bearing random number generators in which is their seed,
	 each according to its kind.}
	And it was so.
	And God saw that it was good.
	And there was evening and there was morning; the third sprint.
